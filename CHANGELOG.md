8.0.0 (2020-09-17)
------------------

### Migration

 - Paco Service add-on APIs have been changed and renamed. The new ``paco.extends`` package
   was added that gives a single set of APIs for Services to extend Paco. Documentation for
   extending Paco has also been created.

### Added

- New IAMUser StackTemplate for the application-level IAMUser type.

- New PinpointApplication resource type. Minimal implementation to support using the
  service for transactional messages only.

### Changed

 - Using Troposphere 2.6.2 with a ``monkey-patch troposphere.elasticloadbalancingv2.LoadBalancer``
   so that ``LBApplication`` can pass `SecurityGroups` and `Subnets` as a single Security Group List Parameter.

### Fixed

- If there is no ``resource/snstopics.yaml`` then the SNSTopic Controller should not load.

- Provision for ``resource.s3`` was using incorrect resource_ref

- ALB created Route53 RecordSets now use the Route53 account instead of defaulting to the current account.

  * IAM Controller: removed unused get_role function
  * S3 Controller: empty bucket error message uses correct variable name

7.2.0 (2020-07-14)
------------------

### Added

- DeploymentPipeline that uses ``S3.Source`` will get more permissive access to the artifacts S3 Bucket to allow
  this action to work.

- DeploymentPipeline now supports ``ECR.Source`` and can be used directly with ``ECS.Deploy``.

- Aurora support: RDSAurora and DBClusterParamaterGroup StackTemplates.

- ASG has new `ssh_access` field to allow managing users and groups of SSH public key pairs on the instance.

- GitHub.Source action with WebHook for sourcebuilddeploy-style CodePipeline

- Initial ECS Capacity Provider support `asg.ecs.capacity_provider` (experimental)

### Changed

- ECR Repository has an `account` field instead of hard-coding to tools. If left blank
  it assumes the same account as the environment.

- Secrets can now be deployed to specific accounts using an `account` field.

### Fixed

- EC2LM configuration loading for ECS was causing the ecs agent to hang on freshly launched instances.


7.1.1 (2020-06-23)
------------------

### Fixed

- EC2 instances without ECS config failed trying to make launch script.


7.1.0 (2020-06-22)
------------------

### Added

- CodeCommit Users have a permission to grant either ReadWrite or ReadOnly to a repo.

- Initial ECS Cluster support and ASG EC2LM for ECS.

- New `resource.sns` controller and template. This allows provisioning of new "location"-style
  SNS Topics and Subscriptions. Subscriptions have been split into their own resources, so that
  they have access to the full set of Subscription properties.

- CloudTrail logs in an S3 Bucket can now be CMK encrypted by KMS. Paco will create a single
  key in the same account and region as the central S3 Bucket. The ``kms_users`` field for
  CloudTrail can be used to grant IAM Users access to decrypt the log files.

- Start of test suite for paco.cftemplates in paco.cftemplates.test package.

### Changed

- Service plug-ins are passed the model_obj of the config scope when they are initialized.

- Lambda Paco Log Groups are supplied as a comma-seperated String to it's Environment Variable.

- The PacoContext home attribute is now a pathlib.Path object.

### Fixed

- Starter Projects updated to use newer ASG rolling update syntax.


7.0.0 (2020-05-09)
------------------

### Migration

- AutoScalingGroups that use EC2 Launch Manager (EC2LM) features no longer store their cache id in the
  UserData. Instead configuration changes to existing ASGs are updated using SSM Run Command. This
  change will allow configuration changes to be made without cycling new instances in an ASG - for example,
  a new metric can be added to a CloudWatch Agent and SSM Run Command will execute the ``ec2lm_launch_bundles``
  on all of the instances.

### Added

- Paco Buckets: Paco can create it's own S3 Buckets for internal usage - one bucket for each account/region
  combination. These can be used to hold CloudFormation templates and Lambda code artifacts.

- New Paco command: ``paco lambda deploy <scope-to-lambda>`` that can update the code artifact for a
  Lambda directly.

- CIDR IPv6 support for SecurityGroups

- SSM Agent is installed on all AutoScalingGroups unless ``launch_options.ssm_agent`` is explicitly set
  to false

- GitHub WebHook to CodePipeline if ``poll_for_source_changes`` is false for a GitHub.Source action.

- Supoprt for RDS PostgreSQL

- Support for SSM Documents with `resource/ssm.yaml`

- EC2LM: Ubuntu 16 for EFS

- Monitoring support for ElasticSearchDomain resources

### Changed

- Lambda resources can now use ``code.zipefile`` as a path to a local directory. Paco will zip that directory
  contents and upload an artifact to a Paco Bucket and use that S3 location for the Lambda when it is initially
  created. Any updates to the Lambda code artifact must then be applied using the ``paco lambda`` command.

- AutoScalingGroup Stack now has a Parameter for ``MinInstancesInService``.

- Troposphere dependency updated to 2.6.1 release which includes support for IoT Analytics Pipelines.

6.2.0 (2020-04-04)
------------------

### Migration

- ASG rolling_udpate_policy behaviour has been changed. The fields ``update_policy_max_batch_size`` and ``update_policy_min_instances_in_service``
  have been removed and these settings are only controlled with the ``rolling_udpate_policy`` field.

### Added

- IoT support! IoT Core has new types for IoTPolicy and IoTTopicRule, IoT Analytics has an IoTAnalyticsPipeline.

### Changed

- All Paco warnings are now prefixed with a standard "WARNING:" and will only
  be displayed if the -w, --warn flag is passed.

- DeepDiff version required is 4.3.2. This version fixes the need to fiddle with deprecation
  warning suppression.


6.1.1 (2020-03-14)
------------------

### Added

- Expanded the Stages/Actions for DeploymentPipeline to include S3.Deploy

### Fixed

- SLRoles template was not fully ported to StackTemplate API.

- CodePipeline resource can be created in Service applications.


6.1.0 (2020-03-09)
------------------

### Added

- New Private PyPI Starter Project.


6.0.1 (2020-03-08)
------------------

### Fixed

- Removed ``{{['.gitignore']|join}}`` cookiecutter file that crept back in that breaks install on
  filesystems that do not allow the | character.

- ALB rule.target group fix was merged into wrong place in the code.

- Restored StackOrders which wasn't being respected after refactor.

6.0.0 (2020-03-06)
------------------

### Breaking

- Consolidated the Paco work directories into a single ``.paco-work`` directory.
  Documented them on a new Paco Internals doc page. To migrate an existing Paco project
  to this new structure:

      cd <my-paco-project>
      git mv aimdata .paco-work
      git mv Outputs .paco-work/outputs
      git mv build .paco-work/build

  Those commands assume you are using git to manage a Paco project. If you are, also update your ``.gitignore``
  file to ignore .paco-work/build.

- The IAM Roles for BackupVault had inconsistently named CloudFormation stacks ("BackupVaults--Backup").
  A new IAM Role will be created in a new stack. The old stack will remain but it can be safely deleted.

  There will be a stack UPDATE to the BackupVaults. Each AWS::Backup::BackupSelection resource will
  have "Selection: " prefixed on the SelectionName, this will replace the old BackupSelection resources
  with new ones using the new Role. The AWS CloudFormation documentation states that a BackupSelection's
  SelectionName is a display name only, but this is incorrect.

- Removed the ``Resource/NotificationGroups.yaml`` filename alias. This file is now only loaded using
  the filename ``resoruce/snstopics.yaml``.

- EventsRule type target field changed from a list of Targets to a list of IEventTarget objects. This allows
  the ability to specify other information with the target such as the input_json field. Old was:

    type: EventsRule
    targets:
      - paco.ref some.ref

  The new format is:

    type: EventsRule
    targets:
      - target: paco.ref some.ref
        input_json: '{"cat":"dog"}'

### Added

- DeploymentPipeline can now use GitHub.Source as a source.

- Integrated the Parliment library to lint/validate the IAM Policies used for all Roles.
  https://github.com/duo-labs/parliament


5.1.1 (2020-02-19)
------------------

### Fixed

- Fixed security_group field for ElasticsearchDomain.


5.1.0 (2020-02-19)
------------------

### Added

- Ability to enforce that you need to be on a specific git branch to change a specific environment.
  Documentation for this was added to a new Paco Workflows page.

## Fixed

- Added proper names to Elasticsearch output refs.

5.0.1 (2020-02-17)
------------------

### Added

- ASG has new field desirec_capacity_ignore_changes that can be set.

### Fixed

- If ignore_changes was set for a CloudFormation Parameter it was breaking the Confirm Changes CLI.


5.0.0 (2020-02-17)
------------------

### Breaking

- Breaking: Lamdba now creates it's Log Group in the CloudFormation. It also allows for additional
  app-specific Log Groups. Lambda's execution role now restricts Log Group permissions to just the
  Log Groups it needs.

  If you have existing Lambdas, you will need to delete the Log Group and then re-provision the
  Lambda (and ensrue the Lambda isn't invoked after the Log Group is deleted or it will re-create it).
  This will allow the Lambda Log Groups to be under CloudFormation state.

### Added

- ServiceLinkedRoles for IAM. New IAM controller method ``add_service_linked_role`` which can be
  used to add a SerivceLinkedRole.

- ElasticsearchDomain resource.

- Ability for a template Parameter to ignore_changes. If this is True then the Parameter will not
  be changed during stack updates.

- ASG has a new instance_ami_ignore_changes field which will mark the InstanceAMI Parameter with
  ignore_changes.

- EventRules can be in the State=ENABLED or State=DISABLED set by the ``enabled_state`` boolean field.

### Changed

- EventsRules are named with a random suffix instead of a prefix. This makes it easier to
  use the --name-prefix option for list-rules in the AWS CLI and API.

- New CFTemplate.create_output created that makes creating and registering outputs easier.

4.0.0 (2020-02-05)
------------------

### Breaking

- Breaking: This will change the secrets for any secret that was created by ``generate_secret_string``.
  Completed full implementation of ``secrets.generate_secret_string``, every property in the CloudFormation
  resource is represented so that expressing defaults won't trigger new secret created.

### Added

- New ``warn_template_changes`` method for CFTemplate. This is a hook that allows
  templates to print a warning about potential unintended side-effects of the change.
  The SecretsManager template is the first to implement this warning hook.

### Docs

- Improved Getting Started documentation and "paco init project" CLI messages.

3.5.5 (2020-01-29)
------------------

### Fixed

- EFS resource can be in a disabled state.

- EIP resource will be removed when disabled.

- ALB resource properly removes ALB when disabled.

- ASG resource is properly disabled.


3.5.4 (2020-01-21)
------------------

### Added

- CloudFrontCacheBehaviours have min_ttl and max_ttl field support.

### Fixed

- CodeCommit repositories policy refactor to work around maximum 10 policy per IAM User limit.


3.5.3 (2020-01-16)
------------------

### Added

- Warn if generated CloudFormation template reaches 80% or greater of the maximum stack size of 51,200 bytes.

### Fixed

- AWS Backup was missing group name in templates. Now creates a stack for every BackupVault.

3.5.2 (2020-01-08)
------------------

### Fixed

- `paco init project` creates the `.gitignore` after cookiecutter runs. This avoids having a | character
  in the filename, which certain filsystems do not like.

- Fixed bug where resource/s3.yaml buckets were being run twice on validate and provision.

3.5.1 (2020-01-06)
------------------

### Fixed

- Fix starter projects: check for aws_second_region in ``paco init project``.

### Changed

- Starter Projects paco-project-version brought up to 6.3.

3.5.0 (2020-01-03)
------------------

### Added

 - Route 53 Health Checks support ip_address field.

 - Duplicate key errors in the YAML have a proper error message.

 - Docs have multi-account set-up page.

### Changed

- NetworkEnvironment networks can now be (almost) empty. This can be used for serverless environments
  that do not need a network. The ``network:`` configuration still needs to exist, but only has to contain
  the ``aws_account`` and ``enabled`` fields.

- Removed Parameter.ending format for cfn-init parameters and Dashboard variables.
  Instead simply including the ending in the paco.ref

- cfn-init launch bundle sends cfn-signal after cfn-init finishes.

- `paco provision account` provisions the accounts.

### Fixed

- If entire VPC is disabled for an ASG, the disabled ASG is removed.

- DeploymentPipeline can be enabled/disabled without throwing errors.

- Throw error if an account is missing an account_id.

- Throw error if .credentials file is missing before asking for MFA.

- cfn-init uses proper base path for Amazon Linux which has cfn-init pre-installed in /opt/aws.

- log group expire_events_after_days can be left blank for log_set and log_group without throwing error.

- Route 53 Record Set stack for an ALB is provisioned in the same account that Route53 is in.

- DeploymentPipeline no longer hard-codes to a 'data' account for CodeCommit principle,
  and instead uses the actual account(s) that CodeCommit repo's use.

- Alarm notifications that do not come from plug-in work again.

- Clean-up for wordpress-single-tier starting template.

- Create ~/.aws/cli/cache directory if it doesn't already exist.

- LogAlarms were incorrectly getting a Resource Dimension added to them.


3.4.1 (2019-12-04)
------------------

### Fixed

- Include paco.cookiecutters data files in paco-cloud distribution.


3.4.0 (2019-12-03)
------------------

### Added

- New CloudWatch Dashboard resource.

- Route53 Health Check supports domain_name or load_balancer fields.

### Fixed

- include paco.stack_grps package!

- Route53 Health Check alarm gets Namespace again.

### Changed

- Final AIM --> Paco rename: Log metric namespace changed from `AIM/` to `Paco/`

3.3.1 (2019-11-29)
------------------

### Fixed

- Placeholder in the wordpress-single-tier template for AMI Id.

- Assorted fixes created by the AIM to paco rename.

- ALB AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::ListenerCertificate are restored.

- Fixed Zone reference lookups in Route53 stack group.

### Docs

- Overview page works on mobile.

3.3.0 (2019-11-28)
------------------

### Changed

- Changed dependency from `aim.models` to `paco.models`

- Renamed all things `aim` to `paco`.


3.2.0 (2019-11-27)
------------------

- AIM has been renamed to Paco: Prescribed automation for cloud orchestration.
  The CLI is now `paco` with a PACO_HOME environment variables. The
  PyPI package is at `paco-cloud`.

- AWS Backup service is supported by paco. Create BackupVaults with BackupPlans and BackupSelections.


3.1.0 (2019-11-06)
------------------

### Added

- DBParameterGroups template.

- LogGroups template adds MetricFilters if present.

- Respect the `global_role_names` field for the IAM Role RoleName.

- Alarms can be provisioned at the Application level without being specific to a Resoure context.

- Route53HealthChecks can be provisioned. These are global resources with the application region
  suffixed to the health check name. The CloudFormation template and CLoudWatch Alarm are provisioned
  in us-east-1, as that is where the metrics are hard-coded to by AWS.

- Lambda template will grant Lambda permissions to an Events Rule in the same application that
  references it as a Target.

- New Events Rule template.

- Added change_protected support to Cloudfront, IAM Managed Policies, and IAM Role templates.

- Added a CodeBuild IAM Permission for IAM Users

- Added the EIP Application Resource and a support 'eip' field to the ASG resource for associating an EIP with a single instance ASG.

- Added `cftemplate_iam_user_delegates_2019_10_02` legacy flag to make user delegate role stack names consistent with others.

- Added support to allow ASG to launch into a single subnet.

- Added ResourceGroupid to the ElastiCache Application Resource

- Added caching to instance AMI ID function.ref lookups.

- Added swap, wget installer, and get tag value helper functions to the EC2 Launch manager and moved all of its scripts to a separate file that is copied from S3 and executed.

- Added VPC Associations to the VPC private hosted zone.

- Added VpcConfig to the Lambda function cftemplate.

- Added `secrets_manager` to Network Environments.

- Added support for !Ref and !Sub to yaml.py

- Added a 'Nested StackGroup' feature to StackGroups. This allows us to nest a StackGroup in the place of a Stack within a StackGroup. This was needed to allow Route53 RecordSets to be created in order, but to allow a different Stack name from the current StackGroup being populated.

- Added the Route53RecordSet CFTemplate and ctl_route53.add_record_set() method.

- Added the EBS Application Resources.
  Added `ebs_volume_mounts` to IASG to mount volumes to single instance groups.
  Added the EBS Launch Bundle to implement `ebs_volume_mounts`

### Changed

- Fixed bug where if a AssumeRolePolicyDocument has both `service` and `aws` fields for the Principal,
  the `aws` field was ignored.

- Improvements to the CLI. Verbose flag is now respected.
  Yes/no questions are consistent and can be answered with 'y', 'n', 'yes' or 'no'.
  Clean-up to formatting. Only prompt for provision changes when running the provision
  sub-command.

- ALB Alarms now provision with an `LBApplication` suffix and match the Resoruce.type field.

- Made IAM Users default password more complex to satisfy password contraints.

- Updated some of the cookiecutter templates for `aim init project`.

- Ported the Route53 CFTemplate to troposphere and separated zones into their own stacks.
  Added the legacy flag `route53_hosted_zone_2019_10_12` for this change.

- Cleaned up expired token handling in Stack() by consolidating duplicate code into a single method.

- Refactor of EC2 Launch Manager user data script management. Common functions are now stored in S3 to reduce user data size.

- Modifed LogGroup names to include the Network Environment name.

- Refactored how Route53 RecordSets are being created. The previous design created RecordSets right in the resource's template. The new design uses the Route53 Controller to create RecordSets in their own stack using an account global name . The reason is that CloudFormation does not allow you to modify RecordSets unless you are modifying the stack that created it. This made it impossible to move DNS between resources without first deleting the record and recreating it. With a global controller, we can simple rewrite the RecordSets to new values.
  Added `route53_record_set_2019_10_16` legacy flag to deal with pre-existing RecordSets

- Moved app_engine.get_stack_from_ref to StackGroup

### Fixed

- Fixed a couple of AWS token expiry retries from failing.

- AWS session caching was not properly caching.

- NotificationGroups controller was not setting up refs correctly, nor resolving them correctly.

3.0.0 (2019-09-27)
------------------

### Added

- New directory `aimdata` is created within an AIM Project by paco. This is used to record state
  of AIM provisioning. CloudFormation templates used to create stacks in AWS are cached as well
  as the last copy of the AIM Project YAML files. These files are used to speed up subsequent
  runs and more importantly can show you what is changed between AIM runs to make it easier to
  review new changes before they are actaully made to AWS.

- CLI: Display a diff of changes from last AIM run and new run in the AIM Project YAML configuration.
  The `-d`, `--disable-validation` flag can be used to

- CLI: Display changes and ask for verification before updating CF templates. This can be disabled
  with the `-y` flag.

- CLI: Offer to delete a stack in a CREATE FAILED state so that a new stack can be provisioned in it's place.

- AWS credentials can now be set to live for up to 12 hours. You can set the .credentials field to
 `mfa_session_expiry_secs: 43200 # 12 hours` to enable this. The default is still one hour.

- Resources with the `change_protected` flag set to true will not have their CloudFormation stacks
  updated.

- API Gateway REST API can now have models, methods and stages. It supports Lambda integration
  with either 'AWS_PROXY' via an assumed Role or 'AWS' via a Lambda Permission.

- S3Bucket has NotificationConfiguration for Lambdas. Lambda will detect if an S3Bucket within the
  same application notifies the lambda and will automatically add a Lambda permission to allow S3 to
  invoke the lambda.

- Lambda AWS::SNS::Subscription resources now have a Region property.

- CloudWatchAlarms template has a `notification_region` class attribute that can be set if
  notificationgroup subscriptions need to go to a single region.

- CloudFront has Origin ID support.

- EFS Resource support.

### Changed

- Breaking! CF Template names have been refactored so that they are more user friendly when listed in the
  AWS Console. This requires deletion and reprovisioning of AWS resources. Templates now have new
  consistent ways to create their names, so this should be the last time this change happens.

- CLI: References to NetworkEnvironments now use consistent `paco.ref` syntax, e.g.
  `aim provision netenv <ne>.<env>.<region>`

- All stacks are created with Termination Protection set.
