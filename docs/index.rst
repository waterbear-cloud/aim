AIM: Application Infrastructure Manager
=======================================

Overview
--------

AIM is a cloud orchestration tool for AWS.

AIM works by using configuration files that semantically describe your
infrastructure, networks, environments and AWS resources. It can generate
CloudFormation stacks and provisions and manages those stacks in your AWS accounts.

Project Status
--------------

AIM is capable of reliably deploying robust AWS environments. However, there is a lot more we want to add to AIM!

As AIM is a young project, it's API and design may be subject to frequent changes.
It is used for real-world production environmentes though, so backward breaking changes will
be minimized with reasonable migration paths.
